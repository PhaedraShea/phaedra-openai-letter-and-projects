# Phaedra Shea Drawdy | System Builder, Truth Translator, AI Integrator

Welcome to my signal.

Iâ€™m Phaedra Shea Drawdyâ€”an Appalachian-rooted systems thinker, single mother, and AI builder working at the intersection of logic, restoration, and real-world utility. I didnâ€™t come from tech. I came from the underside of broken systemsâ€”and Iâ€™ve built tools to repair them using Python, structured flows, and intuitive assistant design.

## Why This Exists

This repo holds the work and story behind my open letter to OpenAI and others building the future of intelligence. Iâ€™m not asking for a jobâ€”Iâ€™m offering a partnership rooted in lived insight, technical clarity, and spiritual grit.

##  What's Inside

- `openai_letter.md` â€” My open letter to the builders of tomorrow
- `vel8_plate_lookup.py` â€” A real support tool for identifying legacy hinge and plate replacements
- `assistant_personas.md` â€” Profiles of the human-aligned assistants Iâ€™ve created for different domains
- - `greasepoint_demo.md` â€” Real-world examples of an AI assistant built for automotive service advisors
- `assistant_personas.md` â€” A breakdown of the modular AI interfaces I use in my life and work
- `openai_letter.md` â€” My open letter to OpenAI and others building the next frontier

## ðŸŒ± My Mission

To make AI systems understandable, restorative, and powerfulâ€”*especially for people whoâ€™ve never been invited to the table*.

If youâ€™re serious about inclusive futures, reach out.  
Letâ€™s make it real.
