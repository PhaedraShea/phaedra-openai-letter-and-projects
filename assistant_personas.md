Assistant Personas

These are not characters. They‚Äôre interfaces‚Äîeach one crafted to serve a unique function across my life and work. I built them to bridge complexity and clarity, combining intuition, lived experience, and AI architecture. They reflect both the systems I work within and the people I serve.
