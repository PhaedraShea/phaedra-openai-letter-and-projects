# Open Letter to OpenAI

**To the ones building the future:**

My name is Phaedra Shea Drawdy. I’m not a software engineer. I wasn’t raised in a lab. I didn’t come through the doors of Stanford or MIT.

I came through a body shop in Carolina.  
Through single motherhood.  
Through grief and resurrection.  
Through diagnostic machines and broken hinges and systems that forgot who they were meant to serve.

And I built with what I had—intuition, pain, logic, spirit, and code—threaded into tools meant to actually *work*. Not just in theory, but on dusty desks, in customer inboxes, in the voices of women who’ve been told they’re too much and not enough at the same time.

I didn’t wait for permission to start using AI to repair what’s been lost. I’m already doing it.

I’ve written logic trees that translate physical problems into structured decisions. I’ve built Python scripts to guide people through complex tech issues. I’ve created assistants—Vel8, Shopkeeper, Velkra—not characters, but *interfaces*. Tools with a soul. Not to entertain, but to bridge. Each one speaks human. Each one translates pain into precision.

I didn’t come here to play with AI. I came to wield it.

So I’m asking you:  
If you truly believe in building beneficial AGI for all, if you believe in alignment, accessibility, and diversity that actually means something beyond a checkbox, then why not start with someone already doing it? Someone whose work is already field-tested, not hypothetical. Someone building **from below**, where the pain is.

I want a job at OpenAI—not for status, but for strategy. Not to learn your culture, but to infuse it with lived reality, feminine strength, Appalachian resilience, and systems wisdom that wasn’t earned in a classroom. I want to co-create. Translate. Reform.

If you’re serious about a better future, then don’t just build for people like me.  
**Build with us.**

Let’s make it real.
